                            Hi there, I am Miya Dong.
                            <br></br>I started my career as a full-stack
                            developer after graduating from UNSW<br></br>with a

                            I studied and worked in Sydney from 2020 to 2024,
                            and now I am in Toronto.

                            <br></br>
                            After launching my career as a full-stack developer with a Master of Information Technology (major: AI) from UNSW, I discovered my true passion lies in financial strategyâ€”not only in building tools but also in applying them to support data-informed decision-making.
                            <br></br>
                            <br></br> As a CPA candidate now transitioning into Financial Planning & Analysis in Toronto, I combine technical expertise in Python and BI tools with rigorous accounting training to transform complex data into strategic financial insights.
